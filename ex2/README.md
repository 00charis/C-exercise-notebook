# Get Started with LINQ in C#
## LINQ and Generic Types (C#)
LINQ query variables are typed as IEnumerable<T> or a derived type such as IQueryable<T>. When you see a query variable that is typed as IEnumerable<Customer>, it just means that the query, when it is executed, will produce a sequence of zero or more Customer objects.
