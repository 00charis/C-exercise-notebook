# Tutorial 1: Create a picture viewer in Visual Basic
(Please refer to the Microsoft Docs website: https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Complete-Picture-Viewer-7d91d3a8)

This is a step by step tutorial.

- Step 1: Create a Windows Forms Application Project

If any of these windows are missing, restore the default window layout by, on the menu bar, choosing Window > Reset Window Layout.
- Step 2: Run Your Program

Be sure you're looking at Windows Forms Designer.
- Step 3: Set Your Form Properties

Properties can be ordered by a Categorized or Alphabetical view. You can switch between these two views by using the buttons on the Properties window.
- Step 4: Lay Out Your Form with a TableLayoutPanel Control

You can add controls like buttons, check boxes, and labels to your form. Double-click the TableLayoutPanel control in the Toolbox.
That's the IDE auto-hide feature. You can turn it on or off for any of the windows by choosing the **pushpin icon**.

After you set the TableLayoutPanel Dock property to Fill, the panel fills the entire form. If you resize the form again, the TableLayoutPanel stays docked, and resizes itself to fit.

Choose the **triangle button** to display the control's task list, as shown in the following picture.
- Step 5: Add Controls to Your Form
- Step 6: Name Your Button Controls
- Step 7: Add Dialog Components to Your Form
- Step 8: Write Code for the Show a Picture Button Event Handler
- Step 9: Review, Comment, and Test Your Code
- Step 10: Write Code for Additional Buttons and a Check Box
- Step 11: Run Your Program and Try Other Features
